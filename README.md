# TechForge — AI-driven Application Development

Repository: https://github.com/Vinaymahto808/techforce

Quick start

- Prerequisites: Node.js 16+ and npm
- Install dependencies:
```bash
cd files
npm install
```
- Start dev server:
```bash
npm start
```

Deployment

- Vercel (recommended):
	1. Create a new project on https://vercel.com and import the GitHub repo above.
	2. Vercel will detect Create React App; use the default build command `npm run build`.
	3. Or use the CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd files
vercel
```

WordPress & CMS services

We now include a WordPress & CMS offering in the app: custom themes, plugin development, headless WordPress setups (WPGraphQL), migrations and performance tuning. See the `Advanced Services` section in the app.

For full project structure and component breakdown, open the `files/src/App.jsx` and `files/src/components` files.

If you'd like, I can also add a GitHub Actions workflow for CI or connect the repo to Vercel automatically.
